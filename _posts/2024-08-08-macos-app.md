### MacOS app recommendation to increase productivity

1. [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/)

    This app shows calender in your statusbar, and you can add and delete calendar event using it. You can also see upcoming events without opening calendar app.

2. [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)

    This app saves anything you copied. You can adjust how many items to be saved. And it also saves copied pictures or files.

3. [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

    It's my favorite MacOS app, since MacOS doesn't have windows snapping feature. I often use screen snapping function by double clicking the app's header.

4. [Fliqlo](https://fliqlo.com/)

    If you want to make your MacOS device's screen saver looks cooler, this is the most popular app.

5. [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)

    This app cleans up residues after uninstalling an app.

6. [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066)

    To make your statusbar looks clean, you need this app to hide the unused icons. You can show it only when you need it.

7. [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/)

    Winrar alternative for MacOS.

8. [IINA](https://iina.io/)

    VLC alternative for MacOS.

9.  [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/)

    Torrent downloader app. If you're downloading a audio/video file, you can also stream directly using the app.

10. [Keyboard Clean Tool](https://folivora.ai/keyboardcleantool)

    Temporarily disable keyboard to avoid accident when cleaning it.

11. [Mac Mouse Fix](https://macmousefix.com/)

    Reverse scroll direction (when using mouse or trackpad), custom command on left click, right click, or middle click.

12. [Better Display](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay)

    Customize you external monitor's settings, also works with sidecar display.
