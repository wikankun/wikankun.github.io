### Local coop game recommendation.

1. Stardew Valley

    Rating: 10/10

    Harvest moon themed games, a bit overwhelming for me because too much things to do.

2. Don't Starve Together

    Rating: 8/10

    Surviving alone is hard already, and now we’ve gotta survive with someone else? But here’s the twist that keeps things interesting: everyone has to pick a different character, so you’re constantly covering each other’s weaknesses with the strengths of other characters. Teamwork or chaos? We’ll find out!

3. Overcooked

    Rating: 7.5/10

    Single player or co-op, this game is still overwhelming.

4. Grounded

    Rating: 10/10

    A game about a group of kids who suddenly shrink to the size of bugs and find themselves abandoned in a deserted backyard. The objective? Survive the wilderness of grass blades, bugs, and garden tools while uncovering the mystery behind why they got miniaturized in the first place.
